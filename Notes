First class


can you just reexplain what is the IDE in short? do we need to understand it or it is for the advanced programmer?





************
If I will ask you


so you are saying int can store a value of any length?


No when we started we defined
int a = 10 # Invalid

a = 10 # valid

and then tried to print, why was there an error?


UAS- True
    1. get me 1 Liter Banana
    2. Get me 1 foot water

INDIA- False
    1. get me 1 Liter Banana
    2. Get me 1 foot water



So like we define string within double quotes but what is string in actual?
"ABC"- String
A- Character
B- Character
C- Character
And if its a decimal number can mathematical calculations be done on it?

# I want to store the all the student phone numer in a class
# I want to store the all the student Email id in a class



I tried to install python using anaconda but I was getting error


doubt there sir sometimes i got confused between
list and array how python will decide this is a array or list?
we are declaring both in []

#Can we give two different types of variable in list i.e. int and string both at the same time?
# which data type will take more time to process




int a = 10
int b = 20
int c = a+b
print(c) #


a = 10






Why you dont do if else in the code?-
Better way to understand is also show an example
that prints true if the statement is correct and false if the statement is false


I am getting the same result with True and False, only the last line is getting executed in both ways






# Case -4
#  """
print("Hello World-1")
print("Hello World-2")
#  """


Line number 90 and 91 is commented or not ?





a= 20

a > 10
a > 15
a > 19



can we put sentence in a list and how to add extra words then how can we do- List
