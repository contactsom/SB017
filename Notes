First class


can you just reexplain what is the IDE in short? do we need to understand it or it is for the advanced programmer?





************
If I will ask you


so you are saying int can store a value of any length?


No when we started we defined
int a = 10 # Invalid

a = 10 # valid

and then tried to print, why was there an error?


UAS- True
    1. get me 1 Liter Banana
    2. Get me 1 foot water

INDIA- False
    1. get me 1 Liter Banana
    2. Get me 1 foot water



So like we define string within double quotes but what is string in actual?
"ABC"- String
A- Character
B- Character
C- Character
And if its a decimal number can mathematical calculations be done on it?

# I want to store the all the student phone numer in a class
# I want to store the all the student Email id in a class



I tried to install python using anaconda but I was getting error


doubt there sir sometimes i got confused between
list and array how python will decide this is a array or list?
we are declaring both in []

#Can we give two different types of variable in list i.e. int and string both at the same time?
# which data type will take more time to process




int a = 10
int b = 20
int c = a+b
print(c) #


a = 10






Why you dont do if else in the code?-
Better way to understand is also show an example
that prints true if the statement is correct and false if the statement is false


I am getting the same result with True and False, only the last line is getting executed in both ways






# Case -4
#  """
print("Hello World-1")
print("Hello World-2")
#  """


Line number 90 and 91 is commented or not ?





a= 20

a > 10
a > 15
a > 19





so sir if we have to print any data from set we always have to convert into list then we will able to retrieved?

What is diff between union and update function





myTuple=( 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 )
print(myTuple[0]) # 10
myTuple[0]=100
print(myTuple) # ?
